# Final-Art-151
12/03/21
For this reflection I’m attempting to create a piece of art that I felt like was more accurate to what I personally feel to include within my interests of learning from this course. I decided to approach a Glitch like art piece as a result of inspiration from the discussion of glitch art and how it can be accommodated. I did something like this before so I’m attempting to make it more advanced and interesting as it was before. I already started with a preferable template from an earlier sketch from this course and built up from there. The other main components for this art piece is the inclusion of at least one or two more topics from other units to help improve and use modifications of those units to make this art piece more interesting later on. For now, I'm in pursuit of putting a corner a special kind of color scheme with great modifications in the middle such as a spinning 3D object.
